# 📘 Project Overview

This project explores how attendance, socioeconomic status, and academic engagement relate to student performance. The dataset (sourced from Kaggle
) includes variables such as attendance rate, grade averages, parental income, and course load.
The goal is to identify key predictors of academic success and support early interventions for at-risk students.

# 🔍 Current Progress (as of October 2025)

### ✅ Imported and cleaned dataset (handled missing values, duplicates, and data types)
### ✅ Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to reveal relationships among academic and socioeconomic variables
### ✅ Generated professional visuals for Overleaf report:

* visuals/histogram_all_features.png

* visuals/heatmap_correlations.png

* visuals/pairplot_academic_relationships.png

## Next steps:

Build and evaluate predictive models (Linear Regression & Decision Tree)

Compare model performance and interpret feature importance
